                        <p><span>Although the concept of Angel investors has been around for decades, it is only now that the field of fintech is really booming.</span> Although many people talk about the lull in markets and recession, and many startups are laying off employees, Angel investors do not pay attention to these temporary fluctuations. Their planning horizon starts a few years out, and they are confident that a sought-after idea has every chance of becoming a profitable business. Moreover, it is during the fall of markets that investors find many interesting ideas, which during the next wave of market growth bring them the desired hundreds and thousands of percent return on their investment.</p>
                        <p>Angel investors most often invest in IT, anything related to the digital economy and the remote sale of goods or the provision of services. Many Angel investors have made their fortunes in IT, and they invest in an area in which they are very good at. The Covid pandemic has sparked an increase in interest in health care startups. VR and AR technologies are also popular among Angel investors. It is largely thanks to their influence that the field of AI has developed so much this decade.</p>

                        <h4 class="body-page__subtitle">Why Angel investors are so called</h4>
                        <p>Angel investors invest in dozens of promising ideas at once, and only one or two of them make a profit. However, the resulting profit is often not even tens, but hundreds of times greater than the initial investment. For this reason, angel investors take losses lightly and are willing to invest in ideas that seem insane to other investors. Like mythical angels, they help people realize their business ideas. Originally, Angel investors were called wealthy sponsors of Broadway theatrical productions. At the same time this category of investors is very vigilant and does everything possible to prevent their capital from going to crooks. This investment category includes both individuals and various organizations. They include foundations, trusts, limited liability companies (LLCs) and other forms of organizations.</p>
                        <p>Angel investors originally appeared in the U.S., but now there are more representatives of this category of investors in Asian countries and Israel. Initially, only men mastered this investment strategy for themselves. However, now in some European countries up to 30% of Angel investors are women. The common feature of this category of investors - they invest in someone else's business at the earliest stages. As long as the business is not developed, it cannot qualify for investment from both venture capital funds and commercial banks. Therefore, without Angel investors, many aspiring businessmen nowadays can not do without. It is not necessary to return these investments if the business fails, unlike a loan, which has been obtained.</p>

                        <h4 class="body-page__subtitle">How to get in touch with Angel investors</h4>
                        <p>Start-ups can apply to several funds at the same time, led by Angel investors. If your business is at a very early stage, it is unlikely to be of interest to large investment funds. Most likely, the investor will want to receive shares in the company with the right to participate in its activities in exchange for their cash contribution. It is not uncommon for Angel investors to form associations which allow them to exchange valuable information and reduce the risk of new investments. In order not to lose their money, these investors most often formalize a stake in the business in the form of shares at the time of their initial distribution (IPO). It is not uncommon for them to have voting rights on the board of directors or other controlling bodies.</p>

                        <p>All applications are reviewed by the foundation on a general basis, so be patient. Statistically, no more than 1% of applicants receive the funding they need. However, the application process will benefit the aspiring entrepreneur in any case. He will develop a business plan, which, sooner or later, will give him the necessary contacts with owners of big capital. There are many people with valuable connections among Angel investors, so they can always help a promising enterprise with advice or acquaintances.</p>
                        <h4 class="body-page__subtitle">What are the most impressive grades of Angel investors</h4>
                        <p>There are quite a few examples where an investment in a startup has brought in hundreds or even thousands of percent returns. That is why Angel investors especially like to invest in promising markets. In the early 2020s, the Indian software market became such a market. Now it is the most popular area for early-stage investments, and dozens of rich Indians have appeared among Angel investors.</p>
                        <p>Angel investors often fail. That is why their activity is possible only in developed markets, where investors can defend their rights in court and where the stock market operates. Angel investors prefer to act in their native countries, and rely heavily on personal impressions and emotions when communicating with startup founders. <span>In this way Angel investors have occupied their niche in modern business and contributed greatly to the development of the most technological fields.</span></p>
